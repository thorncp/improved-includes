and stylesheet_link_tag methods, adding functionality to recursively include
subdirectories.

# Two new methods are made available to all views in the application: 
# - javascript_includes(*sources)
# - stylesheet_links(*sources)

# To include everything in a directory, just pass the name ending with a '/'.
<%= stylesheet_links 'themes/' %>

# All of the options available to javascript_include_tag and stylesheet_link_tag
# are still available
<%= stylesheet_links 'themes/', :recursive => true, :cache => 'themes' %>
<%= javascript_includes :all, :recursive => true, :cache => 'everything' %>
