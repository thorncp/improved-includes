ImprovedIncludes
================

Improved Includes expands upon the functionality of the javascript_include_tag 
and stylesheet_link_tag methods, adding functionality to recursively include
subdirectories.

Installation
============

script/plugin install git://github.com/thorncp/improved-includes.git

Examples
========

# Two new methods are made available to all views in the applications: 
# - javascript_includes(*sources)
# - stylesheet_links(*sources)

# To include everything in a directory, just pass the name ending with a '/'.
<%= stylesheet_links 'themes/' %>

# All of the options available to javascript_include_tag and stylesheet_link_tag
# are still available
<%= stylesheet_links 'themes/', :cache => 'themes' %>
<%= javascript_includes :all, :recursive => true %>

# Mix and match files and directories
<%= stylesheet_links 'application', 'themes/'
<%= javascript_includes 'jquery', 'application', 'utilities/validations/'
